This is a simple, easy to use octonion library, written in C.

My first design goal is to make this library easy to use.

Another goal is to make this a standalone library, thus I do
not make use of things like CQRlib that would make things like
multiplication and exponential functions easier to write and
likely more performant.

At present, it is minimal, and doesn't support the full range
of functions. These will come as I gain a better understanding
of octonion mathematics.


Now: Why an Octonion library?

- I couldn't find something in C that already did the job
- I thought that it'd be a fun way to learn the maths
- While I highly doubt it, someone else might find it useful
- I need octonions for the next step in my SIOD-TR journey.

Have fun, but make sure that you use protection.

Consent is a continuous thing. Tan() is not.

And most importantly, do not 1/0.
